                Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Asmodeus met during their college years. They went to The Abyss school of Business. Lucifer 
                introduced them to the idea of this product once he noticed that the typcial reaping was too much of a hassle. He came up with this 
                product to improve the speed with which souls would be collected in the afterlife.
