            We created the prototype for our Standard Edition Iron Maiden soon after we discovered our passion. It is a device meant to make that hard decision many of us face much easier. Simply enter the device and pick your choice between decaptitaion, stabbing, drowning, and incineration. If you want to go out with your friends, the Standard Edition offers a maximum occupancy of up to 3 people! For a small additional fee, use our recording and email service and send the video to your friends and family!

            When we were making our Deluxe Edition Iron Maiden, we thought, "How can we make this final journey a bit happier and more cheerful?" The conclusion we came to was, "Streamers! Confetti! All things Party!" With our Deluxe Edition, you can go out with a bang! Surrounded by confetti streamers and ribbons as draw your final breath. Additionally, we have added painkillers and delimbing for a slow, almost surreal end. Also, in the Deluxe Edition, the Maximum occupancy has been increased to 5 people!

            In our final Deluxe+ Edition Iron Maiden, we decided to added some more unique additions to the drowning side of things. We thought to ourselves, "Who decides they want to drown, and just hops in your average clean water filled pond?" Nobody! That's who, water is BORING, and you're BORING for thinking that! Now, with our newest and final addition, you have the options of drowning in boiling water, salt water, molten cheese, and your choice Cola, Lemon Lime soda, Citrus soda, Grape Soda, and Root Beer! For a tasty, albeit slightly more painful, end.
